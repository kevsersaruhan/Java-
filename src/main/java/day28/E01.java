            i) Throw Exception ==> Ask help
            ii) Handle Exception ==> Do it by yourself without asking help
        3) Mainly, there are 2 types of Exceptions
            i) Runtime Exceptions ==> you will see them after clicking on "run" button
            ii) Compile Time Exception ==> You will see them while you type your code
