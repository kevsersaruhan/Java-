    1) Object-Oriented Programming Language(OOP) has 4 main principals
        i)Encapsulation ii)Polymorphism iii)Inheritance iv)Abstraction

    2)Encapsulation: Data hiding
        i)Some data needs to be hidden like SSN, password, username,...
        ii)By hiding some data we make our codes more readable
        iii)Encapsulation gives use flexibility
    3)How to hide data
        By using "private" access modifier, I can hide the data
    4)After hiding data how can you use it.
      After hiding data by the help of the getters I can access to encapsulated data
      note: getter methods i) Should have "public" access modifier
                           ii)Its return type must be same with the data type of the variable
                           iii)getter methods are named like "get + capitalized variable name"
                            But if the data type is boolean getter methods are named like "is + capitalized variable name"
                           iv)getter methods do not use any parameter because the return the value of existing variable
    5) After hiding data how can you update it
    6)To do the encapsulation follow the given 5 steps inside the class
        1)Create private variables
        2)Create constructors you need
        3)Create getters
        4)Create setters
        5)Create toString()
        Note: In this class, getters and setters are called "Java Beans" as well
     7)If you do not create any setter() the class will be "immutable class"
